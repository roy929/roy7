voice_chat
1. you need to use python 3.6 and import pyaudio and the flask has requirements.txt, download it
2. you need to run 'flask_server' and 'chat_server' and 'receive'
3. now run 'main', in it register twice to have 2 accounts that could call each other.
4. click login in 'main', call the other username in 'receive' and that's it, both should be in voice chat.
